Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
The app, named GoalCalorie, aimed to help users monitor their daily weight and progress towards weight goals. It addressed the needs of users who desired a user-friendly tool for weight tracking, promoting accountability and motivation in their weight management journey.
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
Screens such as login/registration, dashboard for weight history, add weight, set goal weight, and notifications were essential. The UI designs prioritized simplicity, intuitive navigation, and clear presentation of data. Success was evident in positive user feedback, indicating ease of use and efficient tracking.
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
I followed an iterative development process, starting with planning and wireframing, then proceeding to coding and testing. Utilizing modular coding and adhering to best practices in Java and Android development ensured maintainability and scalability. These techniques could be applied in future projects for efficient and organized development.
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
Testing involved both manual testing on different devices and automated testing using unit tests and UI tests. This process ensured that the app functioned as expected across various scenarios and devices, revealing and fixing bugs, ensuring reliability, and enhancing user satisfaction.
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
One challenge was integrating real-time data synchronization with cloud storage for seamless user experience. Innovations included implementing efficient data caching mechanisms and optimizing network requests to minimize latency and ensure data consistency.
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
The database management component showcased my proficiency in SQLite database operations, including CRUD operations and data validation. Additionally, the UI design highlighted my understanding of user-centered design principles, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.
